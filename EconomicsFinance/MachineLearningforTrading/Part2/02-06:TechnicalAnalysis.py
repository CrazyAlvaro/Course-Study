# Two: fundamental analysis, technical analysis

# Technical Analysis

# - historical price and volume only
# - compute statistics called indicators
# - indicators are heuristics

# Why it might work?
# - there is information in price
# - heuristics work

# When is Technical Analysis effective
# - Individual indicators weak
# - Combinations stronger (machine learning)
# - Look for contrasts (stock vs market)
# - Shorter time periods

# trading horizon:
#               milliseconds      days        years
# fundamental   less              less          more
# Techonical    more              moderate      less

#               computer                       human
# decision speed        decrese
# decision complexity   increase

# Indicators: Momentum, SMA(Simple Moving Average), Bollinger Bands
# Momentum: short period direction
# SMA: buy/sell point, proxy for value, arbitrage opportunity
# Bollinger bands: SAM +/- two std,  # from outside band moving inside band

# normalization from -1 to 1
