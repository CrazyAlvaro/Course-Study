# Compare daily return from one to another

# standard deviation
# mean
# Kurtosis:
# + fat tails
# - skinny tails

# plot a histogram
pf.hist(bins=20)

# histogram scatter are two way to represent daily_returns,
# histogram use bins, and scatter use points in planes

# scatter slope, B beta, beta(0) = a, comparing to SPY

# slope != correlation

# !!! careful with assumptions

# Assume Daily returns normally distributed, don't ignore kurtosis
