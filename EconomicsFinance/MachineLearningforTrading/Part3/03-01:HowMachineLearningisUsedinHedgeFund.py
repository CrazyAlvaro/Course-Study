# The ML Problem

#  x ->   [ Model ] -> y
# from observation to output

# From historical data and algorithm to build ML model

# Supervised regression Learning
# Linear regression (parametric)
# K nearest neighbor (KNN) (instance based)
# decision trees
# decision forests

# select x1, x2, x3....   predictive factors
# select Y

# based on past period of time to forcast future price, backtesting score, confidence score

# Backtesting:

# Problem with regression

# noisy and unvertain
# challenging to estimate confidence
# holding time, allocation

# Reinforce Learning
